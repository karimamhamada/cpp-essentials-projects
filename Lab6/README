# CSE3150_Lab6 â€“ Tokenizer

## Description (from class pdf)
This lab is to build a C++ tokenizer using the STL. Each token has a string token and an
integer ID token.
This tokenizer does the following
1. It reads words from a file
2. It stores each word uniquely in a data structure
3. Each unique word is assigned an integer value

The tokenizer also has a function to output the words and their tokens. Given a word, the
tokenizer will output its numeric token. Given a token the tokenizer will output the
associated string value.

## How to run 
1. Compile Tokenizer **`g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp tokenizer.cpp -o tokenizer`**
2. Compile unit tests **`g++ -std=c++17 test_tokenizer.cpp tokenizer.cpp -o test_tokenizer`**
3. Run main program **`./tokenizer`**
4. Run unit tests **`./test_tokenizer`**
